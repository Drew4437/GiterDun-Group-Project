Methodology:
- We identified our main data set of startup investor data on Kaggle
- We then reviewed the data to ensure it was useful
- After we had some observations, we cleaned this data utilizing a combination of pandas and xls
- We then pulled in weather data from weather api and combined with main data set
- We then started to iterate on observations of the data
- We discussed patterns of the data within the group
- We then decided which metrics to focus on and create meaningful visualizations of the data


Summary:
- We have observed strong representation on the coasts of the US for funding of startups, led by San Francisco ($58B) and New York City ($33B); as expected.
- We found no observed relationship to weather.
- California ($199.9B) is the top state for start-ups which is in-line with the reputation it has. This represents 49% of all funding ($405B) of the companies we examined.
- The majority of the companies, 83%, have the status of operating. The next status level is closed at 7.5%. The remaining 9% have the status of IPO or acquired.
- Of all companies (13,686) there were 58,286 investors, which is about 4.26 investors on average. Max was 53, min was 1. California had 29K investors investing in their companies which is 50% of the total amount of investors.
- The largest acquisition was WhatsApp for $19B by Facebook. Facebook and HP are the largest acquirers by average price paid and total spend. Google was the largest acquirer by count. The top 14 acquirers were technology related and account for 30% of all acquisitions.
